# Carnival Message Stream Examples
This repo contains a sample project with several examples of possible custom message streams. The point of these examples is to be copied into your own project and modified to suit the look and feel of the application.

## App

The app points at a shared app [here](https://app.carnivalmobile.com/#/apps/55ecfaf4613431794f000010/settings/developer). Which populates all the stream examples.


## Deploy 
Copy everything **but** this file into the [public](https://github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-stream-examples) repo, double check changes are what you expect and commit and push. 

Also remove the Carnival Style settings files and source  build steps.
