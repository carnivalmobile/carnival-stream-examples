# Carnival Stream Examples

## Introduction

Welcome to the Carnival Stream Examples source repo. The idea of this repo is to help you to build your own amazing stream inside your application to display messages sent with [Carnival.io](https://www.carnival.io). 

Sample code is available for both iOS and Android, with iOS including both Swift and Objective-C code. We have worked to make the code as self contained as possible, meaning installation into your own is as simple as possible. Once imported to your own applications, you should tweak the designs to suit the look and feel of your own application. 

Alternatively, you can use these samples to learn more about how you'd build your own examples from scratch. 

For specifics for iOS and Android, see their respective READMEs. ([iOS](https://github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-stream-examples/tree/master/iOS) | [Android](https://github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-stream-examples/tree/master/Android))

## Contributing
These examples are fully open source! If you'd like to suggest an improvement, make an improvement or report and issue - please do! We'll review them ASAP and get back to you. 

If you customise the examples in a big way, please comit them back to the app so others can benefit too.
